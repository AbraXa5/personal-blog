      <description>Coder is an Insane Windows box. I start by decompiling a C# executable used for encryption. Leveraging a deprecated encryption algorithm, I successfully decrypt an encrypted archive containing a KeePass database and key. With the key, I can access the database, revealing credentials for a TeamCity instance and a 2FA backup code. After brute-forcing the 2FA code, I gain access to TeamCity, allowing me to upload a diff to execute commands in a CI/CD pipeline. Escalating to Super User, I find past builds and uncover two new files. Using command execution from the pipeline, I identify a diff containing encrypted PowerShell credentials. Decrypting these credentials grants access to the account of E.Black, who is part of the PKI Admins group. Utilizing this privilege, I upload a vulnerable template and exploit the ECS1 vulnerability to obtain an Administrator certificate.</description>
