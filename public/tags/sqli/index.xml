      <description>Intentions is a Hard linux box that involving a second-order SQL injection vulnerability which enables the extraction of admin password hashes. Leveraging a different API endpoint, these hashes can be used to access the admin page. Within the admin page, there&amp;rsquo;s a feature to modify images, which relies on Imagick. This opens up an opportunity to exploit arbitrary object instantiation, ultimately allowing to write a PHP webshell and establishing a foothold. After gaining access to the system, credentials are found in an old Git commit in the website&amp;rsquo;s repository. These credentials are reused for SSH access, allowing access to a user capable of running a copyright_scanner application, which has the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability. This capability can be exploited to read files as the root user.</description>
