      <description>Jupiter is a medium HTB box where I began by exploiting a supposed feature in Grafana to execute commands and gain an initial foothold. After establishing a foothold, I took advantage of configuration issues within a script executed by the Shadow Simulator via a cron job. Then, I discovered Jupyter server tokens in log files and leveraged them to execute commands within a Jupyter notebook. Finally, I exploited a customized version of arftracksat, a satellite tracking system, with the ability to run as the root user, elevating my privileges on the system.</description>
