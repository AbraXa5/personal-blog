# Hey there, I am Abraxas! :waving_hand:

Welcome back to my corner of the digital realm! I'm Abraxas, a SOC Analyst for a FinTech organization, keeping the financial world safe. While I'm no longer a full-time software developer, code still runs through my veins. You'll still find me hacking away on platforms like [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/414497) and hunting for CVEs to sharpen my infosec skills.

Beyond hacking, I find solace in a good book, and exploring the endless possibilities of home labbing.  I also continue to contribute as a moderator to an international community of hackers on Discord called [Republic of Hackers](https://discord.gg/mzRm73QE58).

Through this blog, I aim to document my journey as a SOC Analyst, sharing insights, experiences from the trenches, and showcasing some of the cool projects I tinker with in my downtime. Feel free to drop by, geek out with me as I navigate the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, unraveling its mysteries one blog post at a time.
