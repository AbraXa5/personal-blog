# Hey there, I am Abraxas! :waving_hand:

Welcome to my corner of the digital realm! I'm Abraxas, a software developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, venturing into the exciting world of infosec.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me hacking away on platforms like [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/414497) and hunting for CVEs to improve my infosec skills. Beyond hacking, I find refuge in books, and in the endless possibilities of home labbing. Additionally, I also contribute as a moderator to an international community of hackers on Discord called [Republic of Hackers](https://discord.gg/mzRm73QE58).

Through this blog, I aim to document my journey, sharing insights, experiences, and showcasing my impressive projects. Feel free to drop by, geek out with me, as I navigate the intricate world of cybersecurity, unraveling its mysteries one blog post at a time.
